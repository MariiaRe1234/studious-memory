#### Sort by Length

Write a function that takes a list of words and returns them sorted by length in ascending order. If two words have the same length, they should be sorted alphabetically.

Example:
```python
def sort_by_length(words):
    return # sorted list
```

#### <u>Check yourself</u>:
```python
sort_by_length(["apple", "banana", "pear", "grape"]) == ["pear", "grape", "apple", "banana"]
sort_by_length(["dog", "wolf", "cat", "mouse"]) == ["cat", "dog", "wolf", "mouse"]
```
