##### File Age Filter

Write a Python script using the `os` module that lists all files in the current directory that were modified within the last 24 hours.

Example:

```python
import os
import time

def recent_files():
    return # list of recent file names
```

#### <u>Check yourself</u>:

You can modify the last modified time of a file for testing.
