#### Calculate Time Difference

Write a function that calculates the difference between two times given in the format "HH:MM" and returns the difference in minutes.

Example:
```python
def time_difference(start, end):
    return # Difference in minutes
```

#### <u>Check yourself</u>:
```python
time_difference("09:00", "10:00") == 60
time_difference("18:30", "20:45") == 135
```
