#### Count Words

Given a text string, write a function to count the number of occurrences of each word. Ignore case and punctuation.

Example:
```python
def word_count(text):
    return # dictionary with words as keys and their counts as values
```

#### <u>Check yourself</u>:

```python
word_count("Hello world! Hello, everyone.") == {'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'everyone': 1}
```
