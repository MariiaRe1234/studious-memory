#### Reverse Sentence

Write a function that takes a sentence and returns it with the words in reverse order.

Example:
```python
def reverse_sentence(sentence):
    return # sentence with words in reverse order
```

#### <u>Check yourself</u>:
```python
reverse_sentence("Hello world") == "world Hello"
reverse_sentence("Python is fun") == "fun is Python"
```
