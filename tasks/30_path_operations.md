##### Path Operations

Using the `os.path` module, write a Python script that accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Check whether a file `sample.txt` exists in the current directory.
2. If it exists, find the absolute path of the file.
3. Print the base name and directory name of the file.
4. Print the size of the file in bytes.

Example:

```python
def path_operations():
    return # Your code here
```

##### <u>Check yourself</u>: 
If sample.txt exists and contains "Happy New Year!!", your output should be similar to:
```commandline
File exists: True
Absolute path: /Users/yourusername/yourdirectory/sample.txt
Base name: sample.txt
Directory name: /Users/yourusername/yourdirectory
File size: 14 bytes
```
