#### Stars

Write a function that prints a pattern of stars based on the number of levels specified. Each level increases the number of stars by one, starting from one star at level one.

Example:
```python
def print_stars(levels):
    return # Your code to print the pattern
```

#### <u>Check yourself</u>:

Calling print_stars(3) should output:
```python
*
**
***
```

Calling print_stars(5) should output:
```python
*
**
***
****
